		Do you miss going out for a carefree drink with friends without having to worry about getting sick? Same here.
	</p>
	<p>
		The food and beverage industry has been hit hard by COVID-19. Although bars and restaurants are beginning to re-open after
		 being shuttered since March, there remains uncertainty about how safe it really is to go out right now. Not to mention
		  many of us have suffered a hit to our income during the pandemic and going out in Northern Virginia has always been expensive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here at Lockdown Cocktails, it is our mission to provide delicious drink recipes that anyone can make at home, no matter your level of expertise. Whether you already have a well-stocked home bar or you're looking to get one set up, we got you covered.
