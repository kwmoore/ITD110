<h3>Liquors</h3>

<p>Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker- especially during quarantine!
Liquor is made from the fermentation of grain and other plants. There
are six categories of liquor: vodka, tequila, gin, whiskey, rum, and brandy.
You may have heard the terms "top shelf" and "bottom shelf" when referring to
liquor- think about when you're at the ABC store walking through the aisles. 
The cheap stuff is on the bottom shelf! However, just because something is cheap
doesn't necessarily mean it's bad. Provided below are recommended options at several price points
within each category of liquor.</p>

<h4>Vodka</h4>
<blockquote><em>Vodka was originally made from fermented potatoes, although
it is now usually made with fermented grains.</em></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.abc.virginia.gov/products/vodka/smirnoff-vodka-80-proof-plastic">Smirnoff</a> - if you're on a budget, Smirnoff is the best of the inexpensive brands.</li>

<blockquote>Check out Ketel One Botanicals for flavored vodka! I love the <a href="https://www.abc.virginia.gov/products/vodka/ketel-one-botanical-grapefruit--rose">grapefruit-rose one.</a></blockquote>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Tequila</h4>
<blockquote><em>Tequila is made from fermented agave. The great thing about tequila
is that <strong>YOU DO NOT NEED TO SPEND TONS OF MONEY TO GET A GREAT TEQUILA.</strong>
As long as you look for a label that says 100% agave, you're good! There are three types
of tequila: silver or blanco, reposado, and a&ntilde;ejo. Each type of tequila
is aged for a different amount of time, with a&ntilde;ejo being aged for up to 
three years. Reposado and a&ntilde;ejo tequilas are smoother and more flavorful
than silver tequilas.</em></blockquote>

<h4>Whiskey</h4>
<blockquote><em>Whiskey is made from fermented grains like corn, rye, and barley. There are
five categories of whiskeys: Scotch, Bourbon, Irish Whiskey, Canadian Whiskey, and Japanese Whiskey.

because it is enjoyed neat or on the rocks.)</em></blockquote>

<h3>Liqueurs</h3>
<img src="Images/prettyhomebar.jpg" alt="Photo of a bar cart." style="float:right;width:40%;margin:0px 20px;">
<p>A liqueur is a sweetened, distilled spirit, that usually (but not always!) has a lower alcohol content than liquor. 
Liqueurs (sometimes called cordials) can be crucial elements of a good cocktail because they add flavor and sweetness!</p>

<h3>Mixers</h3>
<img src="Images/citrus.jpg" alt="Photo of a bowl of citrus on a bar cart." style="float:right;width:40%;margin:0px 20px">
<p>For the best home bar setup, it's important to have the right mixers on-hand.
Fresh citrus (limes, lemons, oranges, grapefruit) is necessary in most cocktails for their juices,
and can always be used as garnishes if you want to feel fancy- and why shouldn't you? (If you don't like juicing citrus, I don't blame you. 
You can always use storebought juice, just be aware that some brands, like <a href="https://www.target.com/p/rose-s-sweetened-lime-juice-12-fl-oz-bottle/-/A-14757395">Rose's</a>, 
have added sweetener.) Other fruits and veggies that are used in several common cocktails include cherries, jalape&ntilde;o peppers (or other chilies), and cucumbers. Some of my favorite cocktails
include herbs like mint and basil- consider getting some plants so you'll never run out!</p> 
<p>Club soda, ginger beer, and tonic water are also a must-have: if you don't feel like whipping up a cocktail, you can add those ingredients to a glass
with a shot of pretty much any liquor for a quick drink. (That's called a highball- drinks like a gin & tonic contain one shot of liquor in a small 
glass, with ice and equal proportions of a mixer. You can mix a lot of liquor with Coke too!) It's also good to have cranberry juice, orange juice, and (especially if you love Bloody Mary's) tomato juice.</p>

<br>
<h4>Bitters</h4>
<p>Adding bitters to a cocktail can really elevate the flavor! You usually don't need more than a few drops, 
so one little bottle can last a long time.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.target.com/p/angostura-bitters-4-fl-oz-bottle/-/A-50536054">Angostura bitters</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.totalwine.com/accessories-more/mixers-water-soda/bitters/fee-brothers-old-fashioned-bitters/p/109177804?s=401&igrules=true">Fee Brothers</a> aromatic bitters</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Sweeteners</h4>
<ul>
<li>Simple syrup: simple syrup is basically hummingbird feed for humans. It's equal parts sugar and hot water- put the sugar in a jar, add the water,
and stir until all the sugar is dissolved. Let it cool.</li>
<li>Agave nectar: if you're conscious of your sugar intake, agave is a wonderful substitute.</li>
</ul>
